## TL;DR (Explain Like I'm 12)
- **System design interviews** are like being asked to design a city - you need to think about roads, buildings, and how everything connects.
- **GenAI system design** means designing AI systems that can generate text, images, or other content.
- **Practice questions** help you get comfortable with the interview format and common problems.
- **Frameworks** give you a step-by-step way to approach any design problem.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Learn the framework**: Master the 4-step system design approach
2. **Practice GenAI scenarios**: Work through 3-5 GenAI system design questions
3. **Build your toolkit**: Understand common AI patterns and trade-offs
4. **Mock interviews**: Practice with friends or use online platforms
5. **Review and refine**: Identify weak areas and focus your preparation

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
**AI architecture interviews** test your ability to design complex systems that can handle real-world problems. You need to show you can think through requirements, design scalable solutions, and explain your decisions clearly.

**GenAI system design** focuses on building systems that generate content using large language models, image generators, or other AI models. These systems have unique challenges around cost, latency, and quality.

**Interview frameworks** give you a structured way to approach any design problem, ensuring you cover all the important aspects and don't miss critical details.

**Practice questions** help you develop the mental models and communication skills needed to succeed in real interviews.
