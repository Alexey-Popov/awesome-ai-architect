# AI Agents

> Build AI agents that can plan, reason, and remember.

## TL;DR
- **Agent planning** breaks goals into steps and tools.
- **Genetic memory** gives agents long-term recall through vectors and knowledge graphs.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Pick a framework**: Start with LangChain, AutoGen, or similar agent toolkit.
2. **Add memory**: Use [Genetic Memory](ai-architecture-topics/genetic-memory.md) to persist and retrieve context.
3. **Test planning**: Give your agent multi-step tasks and refine its tool usage.

## Next Steps
- Explore more in [Genetic Memory](ai-architecture-topics/genetic-memory.md).
- Learn about [AI Architecture Patterns](ai-architecture-topics/ai-architecture-patterns.md) for orchestrating agents.
