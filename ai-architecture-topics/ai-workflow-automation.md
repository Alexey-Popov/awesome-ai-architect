# AI Workflow Automation

> Automate the boring stuff: schedule data and model tasks and push new models to production safely.

## TL;DR
- **DAG schedulers** such as **Apache Airflow** and **Prefect** run your data and training steps in order and on schedule.
- **CI/CD for models** treats model code and artifacts like software so updates flow through tests and deployments automatically.
- Use both to keep AI systems reliable, reproducible, and easy to update.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Pick a scheduler**: Start with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/).
2. **Define a DAG**: Model your workflow as tasks with dependencies (e.g., ingest → train → evaluate → deploy).
3. **Version control**: Store pipeline code and model configs in Git.
4. **Add CI steps**: Run unit tests and linting on every commit.
5. **Automate deployment**: Use a registry and deployment script to push approved models.
6. **Monitor runs**: Track DAG executions and model performance over time.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) schedulers** break work into small tasks and run them in order based on dependencies. They handle retries, scheduling, and logging so you can focus on the logic of each step.

**Model CI/CD** extends software delivery practices to machine learning. Every change to data processing, training code, or model parameters goes through automated tests and staging before production. Combining schedulers with CI/CD ensures that new models are built, evaluated, and deployed in a repeatable way.

## ONNX Graph: The Blueprint for AI Model Interoperability

**ONNX Graph** is the standardized representation that enables universal model interoperability across frameworks, tools, and hardware. Think of it as a universal blueprint that describes the computational steps required to transform input data into predictions.

### How ONNX Graph Works

An ONNX graph is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with these core components:

- **Nodes**: Individual operations (Conv, Relu, MatMul) from the ONNX operator set
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Defined data flow points for model inputs and predictions
- **Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays flowing between nodes with specific data types and shapes
- **Initializers**: Constant values like learned parameters (weights, biases) stored within the graph

### Key Benefits for Workflow Automation

- **Universal Compatibility**: Convert models between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other frameworks
- **Optimized Deployment**: Hardware vendors optimize ONNX graphs for maximum performance
- **Self-Contained Models**: ONNX files include all parameters, simplifying deployment
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run on cloud servers, edge devices, and mobile phones

### Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

ONNX conversion fits naturally into automated workflows:
1. **Training**: Train models in your preferred framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
2. **Conversion**: Automatically convert to ONNX format in CI pipeline
3. **Validation**: Test ONNX model accuracy matches original
4. **Deployment**: Deploy ONNX models to any target environment

## Key Concepts
- **DAG**: A graph of tasks with no cycles that defines execution order.
- **Task retry**: Automatic reruns when a step fails.
- **Model registry**: Central store for versioned models.
- **Continuous delivery**: Every valid change can deploy automatically after tests.
- **ONNX Graph**: Standardized model representation enabling framework interoperability.
- **Model conversion**: Automated transformation between different ML frameworks.
- **Cross-platform deployment**: Single model format for multiple target environments.

## When to Use This
- **Use when**: You retrain models regularly or maintain complex data pipelines.
- **Use when**: Multiple teams collaborate on data and model code.
- **Don't use when**: Your model is static and rarely updated.
- **Consider alternatives**: Simple cron jobs for single scripts without dependencies.

## Real-World Examples
- **Airflow managing training pipelines** → [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) (mature scheduler with rich UI)
- **Prefect for dataflow and ML** → [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) (cloud-ready workflow runner)
- **GitHub Actions for model CI** → [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) (tests and deploys models on push)
- **MLflow Model Registry** → [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) (track, compare, and deploy models)
- **ONNX Runtime** → [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) (high-performance inference engine for ONNX models)
- **PyTorch to ONNX conversion** → [PyTorch ONNX Export](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) (convert PyTorch models to ONNX format)
- **TensorFlow to ONNX** → [tf2onnx](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) (convert TensorFlow models to ONNX)

## Common Pitfalls
- **Hard-coded paths**: Parameterize everything so pipelines work in different environments.
- **Skipping tests**: Models without CI can break silently in production.
- **No rollback plan**: Always keep a known-good model to revert to.
- **ONNX conversion failures**: Some operations don't convert cleanly; test conversion in CI.
- **Version mismatches**: ONNX Runtime versions must match the ONNX model version.
- **Missing validation**: Always verify ONNX model accuracy matches the original model.
