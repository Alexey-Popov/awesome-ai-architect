# Red Teaming

> Stress-test your AI system by acting like an attacker and documenting what you find.

## TL;DR
- **Scenario generation** creates what-if cases that expose blind spots.
- **Attack simulations** emulate real adversaries to test defenses.
- **Reporting workflows** capture findings and track mitigation.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Generate scenarios**: Brainstorm or use tools to create malicious prompt and system abuse cases.
2. **Simulate attacks**: Execute prompts or requests that mimic adversarial behavior.
3. **Report findings**: Record issues, severity, and fixes in a shared log.

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
Red teaming treats your AI system as if you were an attacker. By generating diverse scenarios and running structured attack simulations, teams discover vulnerabilities before real adversaries do. A formal reporting workflow ensures problems are documented and addressed.

## Key Concepts
- **Scenario Generation**: Building realistic misuse cases and edge situations.
- **Attack Simulations**: Running prompts or requests that attempt to bypass protections.
- **Reporting Workflows**: Standardizing how vulnerabilities are logged, triaged, and remediated.
- **Collaboration**: Red teams (attackers) and blue teams (defenders) working together.

## When to Use This
- **Use when**: Launching public AI features or handling sensitive data.
- **Use when**: Evaluating safety controls like guardrails or moderation.
- **Don't use when**: Prototyping low-risk internal experiments.

## Real-World Examples
- **OpenAI Red Teaming Network** → [OpenAI Red Teaming Network](https://openai.com/red-teaming-network) (community experts probing models before release)
- **MITRE ATLAS** → [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) (knowledge base of adversary tactics for ML)
- **Hugging Face Red Teaming** → [Hugging Face Red Teaming](https://huggingface.co/docs/red-teaming/index) (guidance for model evaluation)

## Common Pitfalls
- **Incomplete scenarios**: Missing domain-specific abuse cases.
- **No follow-up**: Failing to track mitigation after reporting.
- **One-off efforts**: Skipping regular retesting after fixes.
