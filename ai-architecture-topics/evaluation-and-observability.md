# Evaluation & Observability

> Build AI systems you can trust by measuring performance, tracking costs, and catching problems before users do.

## TL;DR
- **Evaluation** is like giving your AI a test to see how well it's doing its job.
- **Observability** means watching your AI system to see what's happening inside it.
- **Tracing** follows a user's request through your system like following footprints in the snow.
- **Cost tracking** shows you how much money your AI is spending so you don't go broke.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Set up basic metrics**: Track response time, success rate, and cost per request
2. **Add evaluation tests**: Create simple tests to check if your AI gives good answers
3. **Implement tracing**: Log each step of your AI workflow with unique IDs
4. **Monitor costs**: Set up alerts when spending exceeds your budget
5. **Create dashboards**: Build simple views to see how your system is performing

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
**Evaluation** measures how well your AI system performs specific tasks. For RAG systems, this means checking if the AI finds the right information and gives accurate answers. For general AI, it means testing if responses are helpful, safe, and relevant.

**Observability** gives you visibility into what's happening inside your AI system. It's like having X-ray vision - you can see how data flows, where bottlenecks occur, and what might be going wrong.

**Tracing** follows individual requests through your entire system. Each request gets a unique ID that lets you track it from start to finish, making it easy to debug problems.

**Cost tracking** monitors how much money your AI system spends on API calls, compute resources, and other services. This helps you optimize spending and avoid budget surprises.

## Key Concepts
- **Task Success Evaluation**: Measuring if AI completes specific tasks correctly
- **Retrieval Evaluation**: Testing if RAG systems find relevant information
- **Groundedness Checks**: Verifying AI responses are based on facts, not made up
- **Red-teaming**: Testing AI systems with adversarial inputs to find weaknesses
- **Tracing**: Following requests through system components for debugging
- **Cost Optimization**: Reducing AI system expenses while maintaining quality

## When to Use This
- **Use when**: Deploying AI systems to production environments
- **Use when**: Building RAG systems that need to be accurate and reliable
- **Use when**: Managing AI system costs and performance
- **Don't use when**: Building simple prototypes for personal use
- **Consider alternatives**: Basic logging for development environments

## Real-World Examples
- **LangSmith**: LangChain's evaluation and observability platform → [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) (comprehensive AI system monitoring with built-in evaluation tools)
- **Weights & Biases**: ML experiment tracking and model evaluation → [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) (industry-standard platform for ML evaluation and collaboration)
- **Azure AI Studio**: Built-in monitoring and evaluation for Azure AI services → [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio) (integrated observability for Microsoft AI platform)
- **OpenAI Evals**: Framework for evaluating OpenAI model performance → [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) (official evaluation tools for OpenAI models)

## Common Pitfalls
- **No evaluation baseline**: Always measure performance before and after changes
- **Missing cost monitoring**: Track spending to avoid budget overruns
- **Poor tracing**: Use unique IDs to track requests through your system
- **Ignoring quality metrics**: Monitor both technical performance and user satisfaction
