![Business Architecture](/img/sa/business-architecture.png)

## TL;DR

**Business Architecture provides a structured view of an organization's business capabilities, processes, and information flows.** It serves as the foundation for aligning technology investments with business strategy. Think of it as the blueprint that translates "what the business needs to do" into "how technology can enable it."

**Key takeaway:** Business architecture is about understanding the business before building the technologyâ€”it's the critical link between strategy and execution.

## Overview

Business Architecture focuses on the business dimension of architecture, providing a structured representation of the business in terms of its capabilities, processes, organization, and information. It serves as a bridge between business strategy and enterprise architecture, ensuring that technology initiatives are aligned with business objectives.

## Business Capability Modeling

### What Are Business Capabilities?

Business capabilities represent **what a business does** rather than **how it does it**. They are stable over time and form the foundation for business architecture.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Business Capabilities Hierarchy"
        A[Core Business Functions]
        B[Supporting Functions]
        C[Management Functions]
        
        subgraph "Core Example: Retail"
            D[Product Management]
            E[Customer Management]
            F[Order Management]
            G[Inventory Management]
        end
        
        subgraph "Supporting Example"
            H[Human Resources]
            I[Finance & Accounting]
            J[IT Services]
            K[Legal & Compliance]
        end
        
        subgraph "Management Example"
            L[Strategic Planning]
            M[Performance Management]
            N[Risk Management]
            O[Governance]
        end
        
        A --> D
        A --> E
        A --> F
        A --> G
        
        B --> H
        B --> I
        B --> J
        B --> K
        
        C --> L
        C --> M
        C --> N
        C --> O
    end
```

### Capability Mapping Process

#### 1. **Capability Identification**

**Top-Down Approach:**
- Start with business strategy
- Identify high-level capabilities
- Decompose into sub-capabilities
- Stop at actionable level (usually 3-4 levels)

**Bottom-Up Approach:**
- Start with current processes
- Group related activities
- Abstract to capabilities
- Validate against strategy

**Example Capability Decomposition:**
```
Customer Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Customer Acquisition
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Lead Generation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Lead Qualification
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Customer Onboarding
â”œâ”€â”€ Customer Service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Issue Resolution
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Account Management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Customer Support
â””â”€â”€ Customer Retention
    â”œâ”€â”€ Loyalty Programs
    â”œâ”€â”€ Customer Analytics
    â””â”€â”€ Churn Prevention
```

#### 2. **Capability Assessment**

**Maturity Levels:**
- **Level 1 - Initial**: Ad hoc, reactive, inconsistent
- **Level 2 - Managed**: Some processes defined, locally managed
- **Level 3 - Defined**: Standard processes, organization-wide
- **Level 4 - Quantitatively Managed**: Measured and controlled
- **Level 5 - Optimizing**: Continuous improvement focus

**Assessment Dimensions:**
- **People**: Skills, roles, organization
- **Process**: Standardization, efficiency, effectiveness
- **Technology**: Tools, systems, integration
- **Information**: Quality, availability, governance

### Capability Heat Maps

Heat maps provide a visual representation of capability performance across multiple dimensions:

| Capability | Current Maturity | Strategic Importance | Investment Priority | Gap Analysis |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Customer Onboarding | ðŸ”´ Level 2 | ðŸŸ¢ High | ðŸŸ  Medium | Large Gap |
| Order Processing | ðŸŸ¡ Level 3 | ðŸŸ¢ High | ðŸŸ¢ High | Medium Gap |
| Inventory Management | ðŸŸ¢ Level 4 | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Small Gap |
| Financial Reporting | ðŸŸ¢ Level 4 | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | ðŸ”´ Low | No Gap |

**Color Coding:**
- ðŸ”´ Red: Needs immediate attention
- ðŸŸ  Orange: Requires improvement
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Acceptable but monitor
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Performing well

## Value Stream Mapping

### Understanding Value Streams

A value stream represents the sequence of activities required to design, produce, and deliver a specific product or service to a customer.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Customer Order Value Stream"
        A[Customer Request] --> B[Order Entry]
        B --> C[Credit Check]
        C --> D[Inventory Check]
        D --> E[Order Fulfillment]
        E --> F[Shipping]
        F --> G[Customer Delivery]
        
        subgraph "Lead Times"
            H[5 min]
            I[2 hours]
            J[30 min]
            K[1 day]
            L[2 days]
            M[1 day]
        end
        
        B -.-> H
        C -.-> I
        D -.-> J
        E -.-> K
        F -.-> L
        G -.-> M
    end
```

### Value Stream Analysis

**Key Metrics:**
- **Lead Time**: Total time from request to delivery
- **Process Time**: Actual value-add time
- **Wait Time**: Time spent waiting between activities
- **Touch Time**: Time spent actively working on the request
- **Process Efficiency**: Process Time / Lead Time

**Common Issues Identified:**
- Handoff delays
- Approval bottlenecks
- Information gaps
- System integration issues
- Resource constraints

### Digital Value Streams

In digital organizations, value streams often include technology components:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Software Development Value Stream"
        A[Feature Request] --> B[Analysis & Design]
        B --> C[Development]
        C --> D[Testing]
        D --> E[Deployment]
        E --> F[Monitoring]
        F --> G[User Feedback]
        G --> A
        
        subgraph "Supporting Capabilities"
            H[Requirements Management]
            I[Source Code Management]
            J[Test Automation]
            K[Deployment Automation]
            L[Observability]
            M[Feedback Collection]
        end
        
        B -.-> H
        C -.-> I
        D -.-> J
        E -.-> K
        F -.-> L
        G -.-> M
    end
```

## Business Process Modeling

### Process vs. Capability

| Aspect | Process | Capability |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Focus** | How work gets done | What the business does |
| **Stability** | Changes frequently | Relatively stable |
| **View** | Operational | Strategic |
| **Level** | Detailed activities | Outcome-oriented |
| **Example** | "Submit expense report" | "Expense management" |

### Process Modeling Techniques

#### BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: Customer Request] --> B{Credit Check Required?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Perform Credit Check]
    B -->|No| D[Process Order]
    C --> E{Credit Approved?}
    E -->|Yes| D
    E -->|No| F[Reject Order]
    D --> G[Ship Product]
    G --> H[End: Order Complete]
    F --> I[End: Order Rejected]
```

**BPMN Elements:**
- **Events**: Start, intermediate, end points
- **Activities**: Tasks, sub-processes
- **Gateways**: Decision points, parallel flows
- **Flows**: Sequence flows, message flows
- **Artifacts**: Data objects, annotations

#### Service-Oriented Business Architecture (SOBA)

SOBA aligns business services with IT services:

**Business Service Characteristics:**
- Well-defined business outcome
- Clear ownership
- Measurable value
- Technology-independent
- Reusable across processes

**Example Business Services:**
- Customer Validation
- Payment Processing
- Inventory Allocation
- Shipment Tracking
- Invoice Generation
