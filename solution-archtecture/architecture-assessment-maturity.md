def test_services_should_not_depend_on_controllers():
    """Services should not have dependencies on controllers."""
    assert_that(classes()
        .that(reside_in_a_package("..service.."))
        .should(not_depend_on_classes()
            .that(reside_in_a_package("..controller..")))) \
        .check()

@Test
def test_repositories_should_only_be_accessed_by_services():
    """Repository layer should only be accessed by service layer."""
    assert_that(classes()
        .that(reside_in_a_package("..repository.."))
        .should(only_be_accessed_by_classes()
            .that(reside_in_a_package("..service..")))) \
        .check()
```

#### Infrastructure Assessment

import "tfplan"

# Policy: Ensure all EC2 instances have proper tagging
main = rule {
    all tfplan.resource_changes as _, rc {
        rc.type is "aws_instance" and
        rc.change.after.tags contains "Environment" and
        rc.change.after.tags contains "Owner" and

### Common Pitfalls

#### ❌ **Assessment for Assessment's Sake**
- **Problem**: Conducting assessments without clear purpose
- **Solution**: Define specific objectives and intended outcomes
- **Example**: Annual assessments that gather dust

#### ❌ **Analysis Paralysis**
- **Problem**: Over-analyzing without taking action
- **Solution**: Focus on actionable insights and quick wins
- **Example**: Six-month assessment with no implementation

#### ❌ **Unrealistic Expectations**
- **Problem**: Expecting immediate transformation
- **Solution**: Set realistic timelines and incremental goals
- **Example**: Expecting Level 5 maturity in one year

#### ❌ **Ignoring Organizational Context**
- **Problem**: Using generic models without customization
- **Solution**: Adapt frameworks to organizational context
- **Example**: Applying startup practices to large enterprises

#### ❌ **Poor Communication**
- **Problem**: Not effectively communicating findings
- **Solution**: Tailor communication to audience needs
- **Example**: Technical details to executive audience
