## TL;DR
- **Carnegie Mellon courses** are like getting lessons from the smartest AI teachers in the world.
- **SEI courses** teach you how to build AI systems that work reliably in real companies.
- **CMU ExecEd** shows you how to design AI systems for big businesses.
- **Free courses** let you learn without spending money, perfect for getting started.

## Quickstart (Do this now)
1. **Start with CMU**: Take the SEI AI Engineering course for solid foundations
2. **Add architecture**: Follow up with CMU ExecEd AI Enterprise Architecture
3. **Practice skills**: Use free courses from Hugging Face and DeepLearning.AI
4. **Build projects**: Apply what you learn to real AI systems
5. **Join communities**: Connect with other learners and professionals

## The Idea (Slightly deeper)
**Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** is a world leader in AI research and education. Their Software Engineering Institute (SEI) focuses on practical, production-ready AI systems, while CMU Executive Education (ExecEd) covers enterprise AI architecture and strategy.

**SEI courses** are designed for professionals who need to build AI systems that work reliably in production environments. They focus on engineering best practices, security, and scalability. 

**CMU ExecEd** courses are designed for business leaders and architects who need to understand how AI fits into enterprise systems. They cover strategy, governance, and implementation.

**Free courses** from organizations like Hugging Face and DeepLearning.AI provide hands-on practice with modern AI tools and frameworks.
