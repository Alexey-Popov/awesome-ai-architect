- **Oversimplified**: May not account for all differences
- **Assumptions**: Relies on similarity assumptions

### Parametric Estimation

Parametric estimation uses mathematical models based on historical data and project parameters.

**Process:**
1. **Identify Parameters**: Find factors that affect effort
2. **Build Model**: Create mathematical relationship
3. **Calibrate Model**: Adjust based on historical data
4. **Apply Model**: Use parameters to estimate effort

**Common Models:**
