![Quality Attributes](/img/sa/quality-attributes.png)

## TL;DR

**Quality Attributes are the non-functional requirements that determine how well a system performs its functions.** They are the primary drivers of architectural decisions and often represent the most critical aspects of system success. Unlike functional requirements that define what the system does, quality attributes define how well it does it.

**Key takeaway:** Quality attributes are the real differentiators between good and great systemsâ€”they're what users notice when everything works seamlessly, and what they complain about when it doesn't.

## Overview

Quality Attributes (QAs) are measurable or testable properties of a system that indicate how well the system satisfies stakeholder needs. They represent the "ilities" of software systemsâ€”performance, reliability, security, usability, and more. These attributes are crucial because they often determine the success or failure of a system, even when all functional requirements are met.

## Quality Attribute Categories

### Performance Efficiency

Performance efficiency measures how well a system performs relative to the resources used under specific conditions.

**Key Sub-characteristics:**
- **Time Behavior**: Response times, processing speed, throughput
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, network, storage usage
- **Capacity**: Maximum load the system can handle

**Common Performance Scenarios:**
```
When a user submits a search request under normal load conditions,
the search system shall return results within 2 seconds
for 95% of requests with 1000 concurrent users.
```

**Performance Tactics:**
- **Control Resource Demand**: Reduce computational overhead, manage event rate, control sampling frequency
- **Manage Resources**: Increase resources, introduce concurrency, maintain multiple copies of computations
- **Control Resource Usage**: Bound execution times, bound queue sizes, bound resources used

### Reliability

Reliability refers to the degree to which a system performs its specified functions under specific conditions for a specified period.

**Key Sub-characteristics:**
- **Maturity**: Absence of failures due to faults in the software
- **Availability**: System is operational and accessible when required
- **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Recoverability**: System can restore to a consistent state after failure

**Reliability Tactics:**
- **Fault Prevention**: Remove from service, transactions, predictive model
- **Fault Detection**: Ping/echo, heartbeat, exception, voting, checksums
- **Fault Recovery**: Active redundancy, passive redundancy, spare, rollback, retry

### Security

Security refers to the degree to which a product or system protects information and data to ensure only authorized persons or systems have appropriate access.

**Key Sub-characteristics:**
- **Confidentiality**: Data is accessible only to authorized users
- **Integrity**: Data cannot be modified without authorization
- **Non-repudiation**: Actions cannot be denied by the user
- **Accountability**: Actions can be traced to users
- **Authenticity**: Users and systems are who they claim to be

**Security Tactics:**

- **Defer Binding Time**: Runtime registration, configuration files, polymorphism, component replacement

### Scalability

Scalability is the system's ability to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Types of Scalability:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers/nodes
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more power to existing servers
- **Elastic Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on demand

**Scalability Tactics:**
- **Distribute Load**: Load balancing, workload distribution
- **Replicate Data**: Data replication, caching
- **Partition Data**: Functional partitioning, data partitioning

## Quality Attribute Scenarios

### SEI Scenario Format

Quality attribute scenarios provide a structured way to specify non-functional requirements:

```
When <source> <stimulus> under <environment>,
the <artifact> shall <response> within <response measure>
```

### Scenario Components

1. **Source**: Who or what generates the stimulus
2. **Stimulus**: What triggers the scenario
3. **Environment**: System conditions when stimulus occurs
4. **Artifact**: What part of the system is affected
5. **Response**: How the system should respond
6. **Response Measure**: How to measure success

### Example Scenarios

#### Performance Scenario
```
When a user submits a search request under normal load conditions,
the search system shall return results within 2 seconds
for 95% of requests with 1000 concurrent users.
```

#### Availability Scenario
```
When a server fails under normal operations,
the system shall continue processing requests
within 30 seconds with 99.9% availability.
```

#### Security Scenario
```
When an unauthorized user attempts to access sensitive data
under normal operations,
the system shall deny access and log the attempt
within 1 second with 100% accuracy.
```

## Quality Attribute Tactics

### What Are Tactics?

Tactics are design decisions that influence the achievement of a quality attribute response. They directly affect the system's response to some stimulus and provide a means to achieve quality attribute requirements.

### Tactics vs. Patterns

- **Tactics**: Focus on a single quality attribute
- **Patterns**: Address multiple quality attributes with inherent tradeoffs

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Early
Address quality attributes from the beginning of the design process, not as an afterthought.

### 2. Make Them Measurable
Use quality attribute scenarios to make requirements specific and testable.

### 3. Consider Tradeoffs
Explicitly analyze and document tradeoffs between different quality attributes.

### 4. Involve Stakeholders
Ensure all stakeholders understand the importance of quality attributes.

### 5. Test Continuously
Implement continuous testing for quality attributes throughout development.

### 6. Monitor in Production
Track quality attribute performance in production environments.

### 7. Document Decisions
Record architectural decisions related to quality attributes and their rationale.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Ignoring Non-Functional Requirements
Focusing only on functional requirements leads to systems that work but don't meet quality expectations.

### 2. Vague Quality Requirements
Requirements like "system should be fast" are not actionable or measurable.

### 3. Not Considering Tradeoffs
Failing to analyze tradeoffs between quality attributes leads to suboptimal designs.

### 4. Testing Too Late
Waiting until the end to test quality attributes makes fixes expensive and difficult.

### 5. One-Size-Fits-All Approach
Different systems have different quality attribute priorities.

## Conclusion

Quality attributes are the foundation of successful solution architecture. They determine how well a system performs its functions and often represent the difference between a good system and a great one. By understanding the different types of quality attributes, using structured scenarios to specify them, and carefully considering tradeoffs, architects can design systems that truly meet stakeholder needs.

Remember: Quality attributes are not optionalâ€”they're essential. Invest the time to understand them, specify them properly, and design for them from the start. Your users will thank you, and your systems will be more successful.
