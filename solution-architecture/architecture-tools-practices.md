## Common Tool Chains and Patterns

### Architecture Toolchain Examples

#### Startup/Small Team Toolchain

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Lightweight Architecture Toolchain"
        A[Draw.io] --> B[Markdown + Git]
        B --> C[Slack]
        C --> D[GitHub]
        D --> E[VS Code]
        E --> F[Terraform]
        F --> G[Docker]
        
        H[Documentation] --> A
        H --> B
        I[Communication] --> C
        J[Development] --> D
        J --> E
        K[Infrastructure] --> F
        K --> G
    end
```

**Characteristics:**
- Low cost (mostly free tools)
- Simple integration
- Developer-friendly
- Quick setup time
- Limited enterprise features

#### Enterprise Toolchain

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Enterprise Architecture Toolchain"
        A[Enterprise Architect] --> B[Confluence]
        B --> C[JIRA]
        C --> D[Azure DevOps]
        D --> E[Terraform Enterprise]
        E --> F[Kubernetes]
        
        subgraph "Integration Layer"
            G[API Gateway]
            H[Identity Management]
            I[Monitoring Platform]
        end
        
        A --> G
        B --> H
        C --> I
    end
```

**Characteristics:**
- Comprehensive functionality
- Enterprise security and governance
- Integration capabilities
- Scalability and performance
- Higher cost and complexity

#### Cloud-Native Toolchain

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Cloud-Native Architecture Tools"
        A[AWS Architecture Center]
        B[CloudFormation/CDK]
        C[API Gateway]
        D[Container Registry]
        E[EKS/ECS]
        
        subgraph "Observability Stack"
            F[CloudWatch]
            G[X-Ray]
            H[CloudTrail]
        end
        
        A --> B
        B --> C
        C --> D
        D --> E
        
        E --> F
        E --> G
        E --> H
    end
```

### Integration Patterns

#### Tool Integration Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Integrated Architecture Platform"
        A[Single Sign-On] --> B[User Management]
        B --> C[Tool Dashboard]
        C --> D[Workflow Engine]
        
        subgraph "Tool Layer"
            E[Modeling Tools]
            F[Documentation]
            G[Communication]
            H[Development]
            I[Operations]
        end
        
        D --> E
        D --> F
        D --> G
        D --> H
        D --> I
        
        subgraph "Data Layer"
            J[Model Repository]
            K[Document Store]
            L[Metrics Database]
        end
        
        E --> J
        F --> K
        I --> L
    end
```
